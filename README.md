# znamak-practice
A very quick html tool for practicing znamak tattoos for the game Lifeweb. Lets you save designs and view them on a sprite (not perfect but close enough to get a feeling)

Click a square, make your tattoos and save it for later. You can set an optional file name or leave it empty to default to znamak
